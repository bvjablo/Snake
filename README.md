# Snake Game
Personal take on the snake game including multiple unique game modes created with C++

## Summary
I created this project as a way to practice and apply my knowledge of linked lists. While likely not the most efficient way, using a dynamic queue allowed me to track the position of the snake. I attempted to use as little outside help as possible to complete this project, but I had to incorporate the ncurses library to gather user input in real time.

### Setup
To run this project, open the files within a terminal
Then use the following make file commands

make compile: Compiles the code
make run: Runs the program
